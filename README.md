#  Online Coding Collaboration App

## Overview
This project is an online coding web application designed to facilitate remote mentoring sessions. The app allows a mentor to share a code block with a student, observe their coding process, and see changes in real-time.

## Deployed Version
The app is also available online at https://codify-6ogx.onrender.com/.

## Key Features
### Lobby Page
- **Choose Code Block:** The lobby page displays a list of at least code blocks. Clicking on a code block item takes the user to the Code Block Page for editing.

### Code Block Page
- **Mentor View:** The first user to open the code block page is designated as the mentor. The mentor sees the code block in read-only mode.
- **Student View:** Any additional users entering the page are counted as students. Students can edit the code block.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Code changes are displayed in real-time using WebSockets.
- **Code Running:** Users can execute code blocks directly within the app to visualize outputs and test solutions.
- **Solution Matching:** Submit and check code blocks for solution accuracy, ensuring a comprehensive learning experience.
